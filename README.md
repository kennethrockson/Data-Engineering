# Data Engineering

This project aims to extract, transform, and load data from the New York Times and The Times UK APIs to solve for the following stakeholder question:

"Over the past decade, have the number of articles published on cybersecurity breaches increased, and is there a correlation between spikes in article publications and significant data breach incidents?"

**<h3>Objectives**</h3>

- Extract article data related to "cybersecurity breaches" from the NYT and TIMES UK APIs.
- Parse publication dates and analyze trends over the past decade.
- Save the extracted and transformed data into a CSV file for further analysis.
- Analyze the correlation between publication spikes and significant data breach events.

**<h3>Technologies and Skills Used**</h3>
- API: To interact with the NYT and TIMES UK APIs.
- JSON: For handling API responses.
- Python: The programming language used to develop the scripts.
- Regular Expressions: For parsing publication dates from URLs.
